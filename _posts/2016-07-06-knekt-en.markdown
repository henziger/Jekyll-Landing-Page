Knekt was developed by a group of students, me included, at Link√∂ping University as
our Bachelor's project during the spring of 2016. Knekt is an interactive web application
intended to be used as an aid for teaching historical encryption methods and their weaknesses.
If you wish to do some crypto cracking, feel free to try out [Knekt](/knekt/). The project's
report can be found [here](http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:liu:diva-130788).
